1) delay(1500);
2) (I'm guessing you meant why an LED needs a transistor?) because the LED is a semiconductor which will draw as much power as the source is providing it; so we need a resistor to limit the power it draws.
3) Breadboards are the best way to build temporary and simple circuits, since other ways of building them would require soldering and are therefore much harder to use for beginners.
4) Why is there a 'void' before functions? 
5) Why is it mandatory for a sketch to have a 'loop' function?
